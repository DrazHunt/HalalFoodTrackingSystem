# HalalFoodTrackingSystem
This project is in response to the growing demand for accurate information about the halal and boycott status and ethical considerations surrounding food products, the idea of our Halal/Boycott Food Project emerges as an initiative to address this need. With an aim to assist individuals, especially in non-Muslim-majority countries, in easily identifying halal products and understanding boycott statuses, our project becomes a beacon of transparency in the complex world of food consumption. Beyond its functional aspect, this project also seeks to raise awareness about ongoing geopolitical issues, such as the Israel-Palestine conflict, by providing information that empowers consumers to make informed choices aligned with their values. As a valuable resource in the global landscape, this project addresses the need for conscientious consumption and cultural sensitivity. 
# Entity Relationship Diagram for Halal Food Tracking System 
The following diagram depicts the whole idea and relationship of the halal product tracking system. All four of the tables are connected on a one-to-one relationship except for the relationship of one-to-many between JAKIM and Certificate tables since each staff from JAKIM can make and approved multiple certificates for companies/products.
